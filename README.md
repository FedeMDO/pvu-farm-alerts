PVU Farm Alerts Service

The intention of this service is to send alerts to the user when their farm needs care: 
- run out of water
- crows
- harvest ready
- seed dropped

With this, the user can maximize his profit.

# DISCLAIMER: This service won't take care about your farm. This is not a babysitter bot.

In order to work, you must provide your PVU token. (don't worry, you can see the code to check what we do with your token! that's why this repo is public)

The idea is to receive the alerts via a Telegram Bot. This feature is being designed.

Anyway, on the first version we'll be using a simpler way to notify (email)

This project has been thought for my personal use. In spite of this, I have decided to share it with the community as an Open Source miniproject.

If you want to contribute to the project with a tip, here is my wallet♥ (BSC):

I'm working on a PVU marketplace analyser. Maybe it will come out in the form of a web application. Stay tuned.

## About me and PVU:
I'm a Software Engineer, currently working for a fintech enterprise. I invest on crypto and PVU is my first NFT game. I wanted to maximize the profit on farming so that's why I'm creating this service.
